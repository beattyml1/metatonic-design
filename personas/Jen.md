# Jen

Jen was always driven. She was smart, made good use of her time, and worked harder than everyone. In college she went for business and graduated towards the top of her class. Now she's worked her way up and is directing her own department. She's constantly solving problems and removing blockers for her team but some just feel like they would be easier if there was an app for that. While she loves her job she's always dreamed of starting her own company and maybe this is her shot.
