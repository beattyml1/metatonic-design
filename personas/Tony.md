# Tony Jones

Tony is a grew up making websites for his friends. While a bit of a nerd he was generally the cool kind that was like in a band and stuff. He went to college and graduated with a degree in sales and promptyl worked is way up the sales chain to the point he became a middle manager. Whether in websites or in sales or as a manager he's always had an eye for spotting problems and making them better. More and more he's been seeing problems that he thinks he could solve with an app. He know a bit about how to code but more like enough to make some small adjustments or make a feature here and there and the idea of writing a whole app from app scares him. Where would he ever find the time to figure out all the crazy stuff that goes into a modern app. He just wants to be able to have his sales people enter some data and be able to track it down later.
